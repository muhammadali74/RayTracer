### Accelerated Ray Tracer using Bounding Volume Hierarchy

A minimalistic Ray Tracer accelerated using [Bounding Volume Hierarchy](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/aac/aac_build.pdf). The BVH Tree is constructed using Approximate Agglomerative Clustering, thus reducing the cost overhead of constructing the BVH Tree. This project demonstrates the reduction in time complexity in ray tracing with and without using AAC based BVH.

This project was done as part of the Data Structures - II course project Spring 2023.
